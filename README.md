# Smart-Clean-India
the Smart Clean India Website allows citizens to actively participate in waste management. Users can upload photos of garbage in their area, with the app automatically capturing GPS coordinates and sending the data to authorities. The website also helps users locate the nearest garbage bins, reducing roadside littering.
